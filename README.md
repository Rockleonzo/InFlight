# InFlight
InFlight Taxi Timer

This is only compatible with TBC Classic client version 2.5.3 and later.

## Installing

Zip releases are next but for now you can use git, which also happens to be
my preference since I can update with a pull.

```
git clone --branch _classic_ --recursive https://github.com/Rockleonzo/InFlight
git clone --branch _classic_ https://github.com/Rockleonzo/InFlight_Load
```
If you're using Windows and don't have git, my prefererence is [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)])
since it feels like Unix. I'm sure there are many other fine choices - it's just what I use.

Obvously, you can also download the repo via GitHub's tools - just make sure to checkout the _classic_ 
branch or a tagged version since there's no guarantee that main will continue to have _classic_ merged into it.
